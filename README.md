This is old project created in July 2011, where my goal was to learn, how to render 3d world using raycasting technique similar to one used in Wolfenstein 3D game by ID Software.

Project contains level editor, where you can create your own levels, and simple game mechanics, where you can walk around loaded level.


Screenshots of game and level editor:
